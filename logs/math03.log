10. Solve for x by isolating the variable x: x = 10
11. Check the solution by substituting the value of x back into the original equation and verifying that both sides are equal: 3(10) - 4 = 2(10) + 10

Consider the ultimate objective of your team: Solve for x: 3x - 4 = 2x + 10..
Tasks should be sorted from highest to lowest priority. 
Higher-priority tasks are those that act as pre-requisites or are more essential for meeting the objective.
Do not remove any tasks. Return the result as a numbered list in the format:

#. First task
#. Second task

The entries are consecutively numbered, starting with 1. The number of each entry must be followed by a period.
Do not include any headers before your numbered list. Do not follow your numbered list with any other output.

1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms: 3x - 2x = 10 + 4
2. Add or subtract constants to isolate the variable term: x = 14
3. Check the solution by substituting the value of x back into the original equation and verifying that both sides are equal: 3(14) - 4 = 2(14) + 10

************** TASK CREATION AGENT PROMPT *************

You are to use the result from an execution agent to create new tasks with the following objective: Try finding 2+2(5*5)/2.
The last completed task has the result: 
1. Read and understand the objective.
2. Identify the mathematical operations involved in the objective.
3. Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) to solve the equation.
4. Start with the multiplication operation inside the parentheses.
5. Multiply 5*5 to get 25.
6. Multiply 2 by 25 to get 50.
7. Divide 50 by 2 to get 25.
8. Add 2 to 25 to get the final answer of 27.
This result was based on this task description: Develop a task list.
Based on the result, create a list of new tasks to be completed in order to meet the objective. 
Return all the new tasks, with one task per line in your response. The result must be a numbered list in the format:
    
#. First task
#. Second task
        
The number of each entry must be followed by a period.
Do not include any headers before your numbered list. Do not follow your numbered list with any other output.

You are tasked with cleaning the format and re-prioritizing the following tasks: Read and understand the objective, Identify the mathematical operations involved in the objective, Follow the order of operations PEMDAS to solve the equation, Start with the multiplication operation inside the parentheses, Multiply 55 to get 25, Multiply 2 by 25 to get 50, Divide 50 by 2 to get 25, Add 2 to 25 to get the final answer of 27, Create a new task to multiply 55, Create a new task to divide 2 by 2, Create a new task to add 2 to the result of step 9, Create a new task to multiply the result of step 10 by the result of step 9, Create a new task to divide the result of step 12 by 2, Create a new task to add the result of step 13 to 2.
Consider the ultimate objective of your team: Try finding 2+2(5*5)/2.
Tasks should be sorted from highest to lowest priority. 
Higher-priority tasks are those that act as pre-requisites or are more essential for meeting the objective.
Do not remove any tasks. Return the result as a numbered list in the format:

#. First task
#. Second task

The entries are consecutively numbered, starting with 1. The number of each entry must be followed by a period.
Do not include any headers before your numbered list. Do not follow your numbered list with any other output.
